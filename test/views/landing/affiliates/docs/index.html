		<h3 id="usage"><strong>A) Using the script</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>


		<p>To start using the Easy Affiliate Panel is really easy and its explained below:</p>
      <p><b>First</b>, copy all the files in the Script/ directory to your site<br />
      <b>Second</b>, you need to input your mysql database credentials in file easy_affiliate.class.php on row 16-19<br />
      <img src="assets/images/db_configuration.png" alt="Basic configuration" /><br />
      <b>Third</b>, you must include the class file in your site, like this
      </p>
      <code>
			require_once('easy_affiliate.class.php');
      </code><br />
      <p>This should be included in a php file on every page of your website, where a user from affiliate link can enter, <b>before any html output</b><br />
      <p><i>Notice: the code right above and all others is php code</i></p>
      To <b>start tracking/marking</b> a user who has come from affiliate link, you should include</p>
      <code>$easy_affiliate->startTracking();</code><br />
      <p><b>Notice: this function must be called before any HTML output</b><br /> You can view an example of the integration in demo_landing_page.php in /Script directory</p>

      <p>This function will look for "aff=" parameter in the url and if there is, it will set a cookie for this user with this affiliate ID<br />
      <i>Example</i><br />
      http://your_site.com/?aff=1 <br />
      http://your_site.com/product/213.html?aff=1 <br />
      http://your_site.com/event/123.php?aff=1<br /><br />
		Where "1" is the id of the affiliate 
      </p>
      <p>When the user <b>made a purchase</b>, in order for this purchase to be associated with the affiliate, you must include</p>
      <code>$easy_affiliate->markBuy($id_user, $id_order, $price, $is_paid);</code><br />
      <p>Where 
      	<ul>
      		<li><b>$id_user</b>: some kind of unique id of the user, integer or user ip </li>
      		<li><b>$id_order</b>: some kind of unique id of the order, if left empty, a unique id from the page address will be generated</li>
      		<li><b>$price</b>: what is the total sum of the order, from this price the earning for the affiliate will be calculated</li>
      		<li><b>$is_paid</b>: if the purchase is paid right (credit card, paypal) away enter 1, if not (wire) then enter 0</li>
   		</ul>
      </p>
      <p>When the <b>order is not paid right away</b>, you need to include on the page where the order is marked as paid (your admin panel for example) this code</p>
      <code>$easy_affiliate->markBuy_admin($id_user, $id_order)</code><br />
      <p>Where
      <ul>
      	<li><b>$id_user</b>: its a unique id of the user made the purchase</li>
      	<li><b>$id_order</b>: its a unique id of the order</li>
      </ul><br />
      	Including this function will mark the order as paid and associated with the affiliate
      </p>
      <p>When you are ready setuping the functions for tracking and marking purchases, you can show the link to the affiliate panel on your site
      <code>http://address_of_your_site/easy_affiliate.panel.php</code><br />
      (<i>if you have included the files in the root of your site</i>)<br />

      In the /Script directory, I have included two demo files with implementation<br />
      demo_landing_page.php?aff=1 <br /> 
      and <br />
      demo_order_page.php <br />
      <strong>Important:</strong> on every paid purchase, the script will check, if the affiliate has reached the minimum payout sum and if he/she has, will sent e-mail to you
      </p>

      <p>If you click on the cog wheel at the right, you will see detailed information about the selected affiliate, you can change the cookie duration and percent specifically for this affiliate</p>
