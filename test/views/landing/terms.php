In addition, we may delay or hold back any Remittance if we believe, in our sole discretion, that the circumstances of the relevant Transaction(s) or Remittance require such delay or hold back, including without limitation if we thinks that a risk of a Chargeback or refund or any other risk or unlawful activity exists.<b></b></p>

<p>8.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We may at our sole discretion at any time and without prior notice draw and receive amounts from the Reserve, or instruct the Acquiring Banks or Alternative Payment Method Providers to do so, as required to cover any amounts owed to us or to the Acquiring Banks and/or Alternative Payment Method Providers in connection with this Agreement, which cannot be deducted from your Remittances because of lack of funds or otherwise. We may subsequently replenish the Reserve, or instruct the Acquiring Banks or Alternative Payment Method Providers to do so, from Remittance and funds due to you under this Agreement or require that you make a payment to us for the amount required to replenish the Reserve in which case the provisions of Clause 2.3 shall apply.</p>
<p>8.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unless otherwise advised by us, the amount of the Reserve shall be ten percent (10%) of the total of all approved and settled Transactions within a specific calendar month and will be held and maintained for a minimum of six (6) months from the end of such calendar month, on a rolling basis.
